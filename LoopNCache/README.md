Loop nCache
===========

This Maya script helps to create seamless looping animations from nDynamics such
as nCloth. In fact, it will work for anything that can be saved to an nCache.

To use the script, run it from the Script Editor and follow the UI.
If you'd like to keep it in your Maya UI, load it in the Script Editor and
choose File > Save Script to Shelf to create a Shelf item.
